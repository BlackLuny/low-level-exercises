0.	How does an interrupt work ?
    ___________________________________________________________________________

	The operating system uses data structures (IDT) to know which interrupts 
	are handled and how.


1.	What are SYSENTER / SYSEXIT and why do we need them
    ___________________________________________________________________________

	These two instructions are used to implement syscalls. (The reason we have
	syscalls in the first place is beacuse user space *can't* directly access
	hardware / physical mem addresses.)

2.	In which way can a system call be implemented ?
    ___________________________________________________________________________

	Syscalls can be implemented by usign either having a dedicated int code
	(0x2e) a trap instructions (SYSENTER/SYSEXIT).
