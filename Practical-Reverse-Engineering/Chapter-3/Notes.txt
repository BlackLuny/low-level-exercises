1.	What are PCR, PRCB and why do we have them?
    ___________________________________________________________________________

	PCR (Process Control Region) is a per-processor data structure used in the
	kernel that contains critical information about it. **Inside of it**
	there's PRCB (Process Region Control Block) which contains other stuff
	about it. (both undocumented). In order to access the PCR FS/GS are used
	(x86/x64 respectively)



1.	How does an interrupt work ?
    ___________________________________________________________________________

	The operating system uses data structures (IDT) to know which interrupts 
	are handled and how.


2.	What are SYSENTER / SYSEXIT and why do we need them
    ___________________________________________________________________________

	These two instructions are used to implement syscalls. (The reason we have
	syscalls in the first place is beacuse user space *can't* directly access
	hardware / physical mem addresses.)


3.	How are syscalls information data stored/retrieved
    ___________________________________________________________________________

	Windows distinguishes GUI syscalls from non-GUI ones: W32pServiceTable and
	KiServiceTable. They have a base and a limit.

	
4.	In which way can a system call be implemented ?
    ___________________________________________________________________________

	Syscalls can be implemented by usign either having a dedicated int code
	(0x2e) a trap instructions (SYSENTER/SYSEXIT).

5.	Explain IRQL
    ___________________________________________________________________________

	Interrupt Request Level are numbers associated with interrupts and describe
	the "priority" of the int. IRQL is an unsigned char and is per-processor:
	interrupts are handled only if they number is equal or higher than the
	current IRQL. 

	doubt 1: How does the CPU know when to increase/decrease IRQL ? Does it
			 have a queue or something ?
