3.	In the example function, addme, what would happen if the stack pointer were
	not properly restored before executing RET?

	If the stack pointer doesn't get restored before leaving a function that
	allocated space memory leaks occur because when ret restores the old EBP we
	are left with a huge stack frame unused.
