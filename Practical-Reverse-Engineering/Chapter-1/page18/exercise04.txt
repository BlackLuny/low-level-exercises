4.	In all of the calling conventions explained, the return value is stored in 
	a 32-bit register (EAX). What happens when the return value does not fit in
	a 32-bit register? Write a program to experiment and evaluate your answer.
	Does the mechanism change from compiler to compiler?

	It usually depends on the calling convention. If the result does not fit,
	it is stored using EDX:EAX
