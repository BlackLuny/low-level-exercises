- Illustrate how Linux classifies devices

  Character Devices:
		
		The device can be accessed as a stream of bytes. To put it 
		simply, it's seen as a file and as such char drivers implement
		basi I/O primitives (open, write, close and read). Unlike files,
		bytes can only be read going forward (there's no way to go back
		and forth).

  Block Devices:

  		This device can host a filesystem. Unlike Char devices only
  		block-wide operations are allowed, meaning every I/O operation
  		operates on e.g. 512 bytes blocks. Fortunately, the Linux kernel
  		provides a way to manage data as if they were Char devices too.
  		This means that the only difference between them and char 
  		devices are internal kernel interfaces.


  Network Devices:
